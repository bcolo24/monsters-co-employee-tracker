  ## Description

  This project was created to easily organize the employees of Monsters & Co. Without it, it would be hard to keep track of job titles, employees, and salaries. To create this app, I used inquirer, Node.js, Javascript, and mySQL. 


  ## Installation

  Open the integrated terminal and enter "npm install" and "mysql -u root -p" to connect mysql.


  ## Usage

  To use this app, copy the repository off of my github. Then, open the index in the integrated terminal. Once that is complete, npm i and log into mysql using the command "mysql -u root -p". You will be prompted to view the menu. You can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to select an option and enter when choosing a section. Type when prompted and enter to complete the action.
